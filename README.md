# Google-OR-tools-scheduler-
More of a mini project on how we can use schedulers in daily life to automate our tasks, I've used google OR tools. 
Open-Source Scheduler Tools

Introduction: 

This project aimed to streamline and optimize the scheduling process for test centers within a valve manufacturing company. Currently, the scheduling process is manual, leading to inefficiencies and potential delays. To address this challenge, I explored the use of optimization tools to automate and improve the scheduling process.

Selected Tool: 

Google OR-Tools I chose Google OR-Tools for this project due to its versatility and efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems. With its various algorithms tailored for discrete decision variables, Google OR-Tools proved to be ideal for tasks such as assigning valves to test centers and scheduling shifts.

Problem Overview: 

The scheduling problem involves efficiently assigning valves to test centers and scheduling shifts to maximize utilization and minimize idle time. Each valve has specific processing time requirements, and each test center operates in multiple shifts throughout the week.

Implementation: 

I implemented the project using Python and Google OR-Tools. The input data, including valve information and shift schedules, was loaded from a JSON file. I formulated a scheduling algorithm to assign valves to test centers and schedule shifts based on predefined constraints and objectives.
